# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata
This is the Gilded Rose Kata in JavaScript with Jest

## Credits
This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

Emily Bache translated the original Kata from C# to [JavaScript](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/js-jest). When doing so she "slightly changed the starting position. This means \[she has\] actually done a small amount of refactoring already compared with the original form of the kata, and made it easier to get going with writing tests by giving you one failing unit test to start with."
